This is a paragraph about myself. I live in Lancaster, PA. I have two cats. I have three siblings
and two parents. I work at a company called Benefix and I work as an analyst. I am in graduate school
and I am learning Italian. I like to sing and dance and I play the drums. I like to go for walks
by the river and I'm excited for the spring weather and the birds! <3
